Notes for PUP design

PUP Load order and logic:
1)Hatch - Domed or Flat (maybe do a low poly custom shader for this portion)
2)Gullwing - Standard or Gullwing (Will determine if full length hatch and lowsides will be loaded)
    a)If gullwing is selected, load gullwing and shorter low sides and hatch
    b)If Standard is selected, load full length hatch and lowsides
    c)Upon selection, load actual model (already downloaded)
3)Headache Rack
    a)If yes is selected, load hex by default
        i)Hex is selected already
        ii)if Post is selected, load Post, replace Hex.
4)
