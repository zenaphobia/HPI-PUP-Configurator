Notes for PUP design

Bugs:
When clicking on the Gladiator, left side T-handle and accessories disappear.
    //Solution: Remove parent (Low side lids) from the rest of the meshes (T-handle, hatch stiffener, etc.)

To-Do:
1) Add BK62 texture to gladiator meshes.
2) Replace DP textures (Need to replace textures in code)
3) Fix Bugs - see above
4) Need to add function to add lights
